1. Introduction

The fastest C++ container class library. 
AbaxMap      -- hashed and sorted key-value store. Keys can be composite keys such as in "%d,%s,%d" format.
AbaxMultiMap -- hashed and sorted multiple key-value store. Keys can be composite keys such as in "%d,%s,%d" format.
AbaxSet      -- hashed and sorted key store. Keys can be composite keys such as in "%d,%s,%d" format.
AbaxMultiSet -- hashed and sorted multi-key store. Keys can be composite keys such as in "%d,%s,%d" format.
AbaxHashMap  -- hash table of key-value store. 
AbaxHashSet  -- hash table of key store. 
AbaxHashList -- linked list with hash access, with insertion order and key order.
AbaxCounter  -- key store with counts of the keys, with key order and count order.
AbaxPriorityQueue  -- priority queue
AbaxVector   -- vector class
AbaxQueue    -- queue data structure
AbaxStack    -- stack data structure
AbaxList     -- single linked list
AbaxGraph    -- dynamic undirected/directed graph, with nodes, links (edges), link properties, link weights.
AbaxReadWriteMutex -- read and write mutex for locking objects
AbaxClock    -- stop watch
AbaxMemory   -- memory tracker

2. How to install

   Use root account or sudo account:

   # tar zxf abaxN.C++.X86_64.tar.gz
   # cd abaxN.C++.X86_64
   # ./install.sh

   (N is the version number of the package).
