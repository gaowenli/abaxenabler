Purchase Agreement for the Floating License.

    4.2. Payments: If the applicable Purchase Agreement does not contain specific payment terms, payment 
of the Fees will be due within 30 days after the date of Exeray's invoice. All payments must be made in U.S. 
dollars. If full payment is not received by Exeray by the scheduled due date, Exeray will have the right to 
withhold  the issuing of License Keys and/or terminate this agreement or a Purchase Agreement and make 
all remaining payments immediately due. All payments that you make to Exeray are non-refundable. If you

from your license, or use of Exeray products and services. If applicable law requires Exeray to collect and 
remit any such taxes, Exeray may invoice you for such taxes and you agree to pay the invoiced amount to 
Exeray. If you are required by the respective jurisdiction where the Licensed Products are used, or where 
services are provided, to withhold taxes from payments to Exeray, you may withhold from the total amount 
the minimum amount required (but no more). You may only withhold taxes associated to a payment at the

6. Confidentiality
    6.1. Obligations: Each party, you or Exeray, agrees to abide by the following confidentiality obligations 
in regard to the other party's Confidential Information: 
(a) do not disclose it to any third party unless:  (i) the disclosure is expressly allowed under this 
agreement,  (ii) the other party has given its specific and express prior written approval, or  (iii) the 
disclosure is required by a valid court order or subpoena; 
(b)  do not use it for any reason other than to exercise its rights and perform its obligation under this 
agreement; 
(c)  and protect it from unauthorized disclosure in the same way as that party protects its own 
Confidential Information, and in any event with reasonable precautions.

    6.2.  Notifications: If you must disclose Exeray's Confidential Information in order to comply with a valid 
court order or subpoena, you must promptly notify and cooperate with Exeray if Exeray chooses to contest 
the disclosure requirement, seek confidential treatment of the information to be disclosed, or to limit the 
nature or scope of the information to be disclosed. Exeray agrees do the same if it believes it must disclose 
your Confidential Information in these circumstances.

Product. This Agreement will terminate immediately without notice from Exeray if you violate any term of 
this Agreement.  If you bring or threaten to bring a patent claim against Exeray (including any claim, cross-
claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) to enforce any patents that you allege are infringed by the Licensed 
Product, then your rights under this agreement will terminate immediately. In the event of termination,

when used on the correct platform and according to the instructions in the corresponding Documentation. 
    8.3. Claims: During the warranty period, if you believe the warranty has been breached and if you wish 
to claim a breach of the warranty, you must notify Exeray in writing of the Error or Errors that you have 
encountered and provide Exeray with all the information you have, in written or electronic form, about 
those Errors, so that Exeray can attempt to reproduce, diagnose, and correct the Errors.
    8.4. Exclusive Remedy: Exeray will provide exclusive remedy to you for any breach of this warranty. 
The provided exclusive remedy is that Exeray will take commercially reasonable efforts, at no charge, to 
correct the Errors you have reported or provide a replacement product that does not contain these Errors, 
or if Exeray is unable to provide a correction or a replacement or determines that it will not be feasible to do 
so, Exeray will refund the Fees you paid for the applicable license. Your remedy set forth herein is exclusive 
and the total liability of Exeray with respect to the Licensed Product, whether based on contract, warranty, 
tort, negligence, indemnification, strict liability or otherwise, shall not exceed the purchase price of the 
Software License upon which liability is based. 
    8.5. Disclaimer: This is the only warranty Exeray provides for the Licensed Products. Except for this 
warranty, all Licensed Products, Documentation, are provided "AS IS". Exeray makes no other warranty or 
condition of any kind, either expressed or implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the Licensed 
Product including, but not limited to, the implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for 
a particular purpose. In no event shall Exeray be liable for any direct, indirect, special, consequential, or 
incidental or damages  (including without limitation, loss or damage of data, damages for loss of revenues or 
profits, business interruption, loss of business information, and the like) arising out of the use, misuse, or 
inability to use the Licensed Product. 

9. Other Terms
    9.1. Compliance Verification: Exeray may audit your use of the Licensed Products and Documentation 
to verify your compliance with this agreement. Exeray may use its own employees and or employees of an 
independent auditing firm that is subject to appropriate confidentiality obligations for the audit. You agree 
to give Exeray or the auditing firm reasonable access to your facilities. You agree to create, retain, and 
provide to Exeray and its auditors accurate written records, system tool outputs, and other system 
information sufficient for purposes of conducting these audits. Exeray will give you at least five business days 
advance notice before conducting an audit. Audits will be conducted in a manner that minimizes 
disruption to your business, and may be conducted on your premises or in your cloud environment, during 
normal business hours and no more than once per year, unless Exeray has a good-faith basis for believing 
that more frequent audits are warranted.  Exeray will notify you in writing if any such verification reveals 
that you have used Licensed Product in excess of its authorized use or is otherwise not in compliance with 
this agreement.  You agree to promptly pay directly to Exeray the charges that Exeray specifies in an invoice 
for (a) any such excess use, (b) support for such excess use for the lesser of the duration of such excess use or 
two years, (c) all costs and expenses incurred in conducting the audit, and (d) any additional charges and 
other liabilities determined as a result of such verification. The rights and obligations set forth in this Section 
9.1 remain in effect during the period the Licensed Product is licensed to you, and for two years thereafter.  

  9.2. Export Controls: Exeray software products or documentation covered under this agreement are 
subject to United States export controls and the trade laws of other countries. You and Exeray agree to 
comply with all export control regulations and to obtain any required licenses or classification to export, 
transfer, re-export or import the Licensed Product, directly or indirectly. You also agree not to export or 
re-export, without a U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security license or license exception, to entities on the 
current U.S. export exclusion lists or to any embargoed or terrorist countries as specified in the U.S. export 
laws. You will not use the Licensed Product for prohibited nuclear, missile, or chemical biological 
weaponry end uses. Please consult the Bureau of Industry and Security web page www.bis.doc.gov before 
exporting Exeray products from the United States. Exeray assumes no responsibility for your failure to 
obtain any necessary export approvals.

  9.3. Governing Law; Jurisdiction: This agreement is governed by the laws of the United States and the 
State of California, without regard to conflicts of laws principles. The federal and state courts located in 
Contra Costa County, California have exclusive jurisdiction over any disputes arising from or relating to 
this agreement, and you consent to such jurisdiction and venue.

  9.4. Notices: Any notice, approval, consent, or other communication intended to have legal effect under 
this agreement must be given to the other party in written form, must be sent by first-class, registered, or 
overnight mail or private overnight, and will be deemed given upon receipt or when delivery is refused. 

  9.5. Waivers: Either party's failure to enforce any provision of this agreement will not be deemed a waiver 
of the future enforcement of that provision or enforcement of any other provision. In order to be binding, a 
waiver must be in writing and signed by the party giving the waiver.

  9.6. Severability: If any provision in this agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable as written, the 
remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect and the invalid or unenforceable provision is to be 
construed (and, if necessary, modified) so that it is valid and enforceable to the greatest extent possible.

  9.7. Attorneys' Fees: In the event of any litigation arising from or related to this agreement, or the services 
provided under this agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the non-prevailing 
party all reasonable costs incurred including staff time, court costs, attorney's fees, and all other related 
expenses incurred in such litigation.

  9.8. Remedies: All rights and remedies of either party are cumulative, except for the exclusive remedies 
expressly provided in this agreement. You agree that monetary damages alone would not be sufficient 
enough to compensate Exeray fully for its damages, and therefore Exeray will be entitled to injunctive relief 
in the event of your breach of the license restrictions or confidentiality provisions in this agreement.

  9.9. Force Majeure: Neither party will be responsible for delay or failure to perform its obligations under 
this agreement, except payment obligations, if and to the extent caused by the occurrence of a Force 
Majeure. For purposes of this agreement, Force Majeure shall mean a cause or event that is not reasonably 
foreseeable or otherwise caused by or under the control of the party claiming Force Majeure, including acts 
of God, fires, floods, earthquakes, explosions, riots, wars, hurricane, governmental action, labor strikes, 
supplier failures, or any other event or circumstance beyond that party's reasonable control.

  9.10. Entire Agreement: This agreement and any applicable attachments and Purchase Agreements are the 
entire agreement between Exeray and you concerning its subject matter, and supersede any prior or 
contemporaneous agreements, communications, or understandings (whether written or oral). However, any 
confidentiality or nondisclosure agreements that Exeray previously entered into with you will remain in 
effect (according to their terms) with respect to the confidential information disclosed thereunder.

  9.11. Amendments:  You and Exeray may make amendments to this agreement only by authorized 
representatives of both parties by means of signed, written form. No additional or inconsistent terms on any 
purchase order or similar document you may submit to Exeray will have any legal effect.
